Migrations
rename twitter_friends as friends and spotify artists as artists?


Other
move rspotify/oauth gem into gemfile

potential source of problem
authenticate spotify in application.rb

probably should have spotify artist and track search happen when you click
create playlist.

Don't know if we need tables for spotify artists and tracks. Probably overly
complicated at this point.
